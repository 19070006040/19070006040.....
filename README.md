# Api Project for a Travel Company
## Education Appointment Form

I attempted to develop an API project for a travel company using Bootstrap in my Se-3355 midterm assignment. Firstly, I established the connection with Bootstrap through HTML and created the required menu links. I designed input fields for the user to enter title, name, email, phone number texts in the education appointment form. I used the mocky.io service to fetch and display the dropdowns for Course type and country in my JavaScript code. To validate that the phone number has the correct number of digits and is a Turkish phone number, I wrote a phone number validation function in my JavaScript code. In the CSS part, I utilized the CSS properties of Bootstrap. After the user enters all the information correctly and completely, they can submit the forms by confirming the terms and conditions with the 'Request and Appointment' button. Upon submission, they receive confirmation that their forms have been submitted on the page that appears.
